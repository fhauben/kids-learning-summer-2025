I want you to create a 5 step programming language tutorial with test cases to run against each step based on the following things:

1. What kind of profile the person learning has. They are either a front end, back end, full stack developer, or have no experience with programming whatsoever. The tutorial should be basic but the difficulty should still be based on their profile.

2. The type of programming language they request: {{technology}}.

Constraints:
1. For now, the tutorial should be focused on single file development.

Other details:  
1. I want the introduction to the tutorials and each step to have a lot of detail and depth.
